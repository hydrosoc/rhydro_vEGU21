# Using R in Hydrology - vEGU2021 Short Course

Conveners: Katie Smith, Louise Slater, Guillaume Thirel, Ilaria Prosdocimi and Abdou Khouakhi


## Details 
- **Where?** Wednesday 28 April, 10:00-11:00 [Zoom]()...; 
- [Using R in Hydrology vEGU21 (link to session)](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU21/session/38926 "Link to vEGU Session Description")
- **What?** This session is aimed at hydrologists who are interested in hearing more about R as well as those who are advanced R programmers wanting to discuss recent developments in an open environment. 
- The session is organised in cooperation with the [Young Hydrologic Society (YHS)](https://younghs.com/ "Young Hydrologic Society website") .
- Participants are invited to post and discuss questions in the [Hydrology in R Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1130214777123909/ "link to Hydro-R Facebook group")

## Topics:
The detailed and time-tabled list of contributions, tutorials and discussion points will be here as soon it's ready.

## Slides
All materials to reproduce the slides and analyses are available on this repository.
To get everything (slides, data, code, etc.) onto your local machine, we recommend to [download the whole github course repository](https://codeload.github.com/hydrosoc/rhydro_vEGU21/zip/master). Individual presentations (*.html* or PDF files) can be downloaded from the [presentations folder](./presentations) and viewed in a regular web browser.

## Checks
We will provide any relevant information you require to follow along during the course in due time. This includes software (versions) and any other materials. Stay tuned!  

**Update**: 
Any update here.....


To follow along, participants may wish to run the following code before the session: 

- install.packages(c( "tidyverse", "sf", "rgee", "leaflet", "ncdf4","lubridate", "ggplot2", "raster", "rgdal"........))
- You need a [Google Earth Engine (GEE) account](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/#!/) to be able to access GEE data. Details on `rgee` package, how to install and initialize GEE from within R can be found [here](https://r-spatial.github.io/rgee/) 
- Other items
